# Resources

Welcome to the [DeveloperDAO](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/developer-dao) **Knowledge Base**.

The community has created this knowledge base to help you **learn** and **grow** in your Web3 journey, whether you want to start learning about Web3, or you're building your first dApp, or you're deep into the world of solidity.

## Terminology

- Visit the [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md) to understand more about a specific term.

## Getting Started with Web3 Development

### 💡 Learning about Web3

- [What is Web3? The Decentralized Internet of the Future Explained](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-web3/)
- [How to Break into Ethereum, Crypto, and Web3 as a Developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/breaking-into-ethereum-crypto-web3-as-a-developer/)

### 📄 Tutorials

- [The Complete Guide to Full Stack Ethereum Development](https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-ethereum-development-3j13)

  This guide by [Nader Dabit](https://github.com/dabit3) is especially useful for Web2 devs and provides a basic understanding of building a full stack dApp from end-to-end using technologies including Hardhat, Solidity, Ethers.js, The Graph, and React.

- [How to write your first decentralized app - scaffold-eth Challenge 1: Staking dApp](https://dev.to/stermi/scaffold-eth-challenge-1-staking-dapp-4ofb)

  This guide by [Emanuele Ricci](https://twitter.com/StErMi) will cover in depth the first speed run challenge from scaffold-eth. Inside you will find web3/solidity concepts, explanations and detailed code review.

- [How to create an ERC20 Token and a Solidity Vendor Contract to sell/buy your own token](https://dev.to/stermi/how-to-create-an-erc20-token-and-a-solidity-vendor-contract-to-sell-buy-your-own-token-4j1m)

  This guide by [Emanuele Ricci](https://twitter.com/StErMi) will cover in depth the second speed run challenge from scaffold-eth. Inside you will find web3/solidity concepts, explanations and detailed code review.

- [How to deploy your first smart contract on Ethereum with Solidity and Hardhat](https://dev.to/stermi/how-to-deploy-your-first-smart-contract-on-ethereum-with-solidity-and-hardhat-5efc)

  This guide by [Emanuele Ricci](https://twitter.com/StErMi) will cover how to configure Hardhat to compile, deploy test and debug a Solidity project. You will learn to create a smart contract, test it with Waffle, deploy it on Rinkeby and get it verified by Etherscan.
